            <a href="#">A <b>site</b> or <b>website </b>is a central location of web <br>
                pages that are related and accessed by visiting</a> the <br>
            <img src="./Asset/my snip.PNG" alt="">
            <a href="#"> home page</a> of the website using a browser. For <br>
            example, the Computer Hope website address <br>
            <a href="#"> URL</a> (Uniform Resource Locator) is <br>
            <a href="#">https://www.computerhope.com. From our home <br>
                page, you could get access to any of the web</a> <br>
            pages (like this one) contained on our website. <br>
            The image shows how the Computer Hope <br>
            website looked in 2021. <br>
        </p>

        <h3>How to open a website</h3>

        <p class="p4">To view a website requires a browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, Firefox, or
            Chrome).
            For<br>
            example, you are reading this web page using a browser. Once in a browser, you can open a website by<br>
            entering the URL in the address bar. For example, typing "https://www.computerhope.com" opens the<br>
            Computer Hope home page. If you don't know the URL of the website you want to visit, you can use a<br>
            search engine to find the website on the Internet.</p>

        <h3>When was the first website created?</h3>

        <p class="p5">The first website was built at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee and launched on August 6, 1991. Visit
            <br>
            and browse the first website</p>

        <h3>How many websites are on the Internet?</h3>

        <p class="p6">As of January 2018, depending on which survey or hosting company being referenced, there are
            between <br>
            1.3 and 1.8 billion websites. Many of these websites are unused or not visited by many people, but the
            <br>
            websites still exist and included in the count.</p>

        <h3>What is the difference between a website and a web page?</h3>

        <p class="p7">A website refers to a central location with more than one web page or several web pages. For
            example, <br>
            Computer Hope is considered a website, which contains thousands of different web pages, including
            the<br>
            page you're reading now. <br>
            <img src="./Asset/http.PNG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p class="fr">In the above URL example, the website is computerhope.com, and the web page is "url.htm."</p>

        <p class="tree"><b>Tip:</b> A web page does not need a file extension like .htm or .html to be a web page.
            Many sites are <br>
            designed to show a default page in a directory (e.g., index.html) or set up to have no file extensions
        </p>

        <p id="free"><b>Tip:</b> See our web page definition for a breakdown of all the elements that help make up a
            web page.</p>

        <h3>Who creates websites on the Internet?</h3>

        <p class="p3">Any business, government, organization, or person can create a website on the Internet. Today,
            the <br>
            Internet consists of billions of websites created by billions of different people. You can even create a
            <br>
            website or blog on the Internet. See the below types of websites section for a list of the types of <br>
            categories of websites.</p>

        <h3>What can you do on a website?</h3>

        <p class="green">On most websites, you read the information contained on each web page. If there are any
            interesting <br>
            hyperlinks, you follow those links by clicking or tapping on them to find more information or perform a
            <br>
            task. You can also listen to music, watch videos, shop, communicate, and much more on many websites.</p>

        <h3>Types of websites</h3>

        <p class="green">There are billions of websites on the Internet today that can be broken into one of the
            following types of <br>
            website categories. Keep in mind that it is possible for a website to fall into more than one of the
            <br>
            following categories. For example, a website may also be a forum, webmail, blog, or search engine.</p>

        <h4>Archive website</h4>

        <p class="few">An <b>archive website</b> is a site that keeps a record of the contents of one or more other
            websites.<br> The
            Internet Archive is the best example of an archive website.</p>

        <h4>Blog (weblog)</h4>

        <p class="few">A <b>blog</b> is a website that is often created by an individual to keep a list of entries
            that interests them. <br> See
            our weblog definition for a full description, services used to create a blog, and related pages. <br> A
            <b>microblog website</b> is also another popular form of blogging website that limits the number of
            characters<br>
            someone can post in each blog entry. Twitter is an example of a social networking website for a
            microblog.</p>

        <h4>Business website and corporate website</h4>

        <p class="few">A <b>business website</b> or <b>corporate website</b> is created to provide account information
            and access
            to <br>
            customers, partners, clients, and potential customers.</p>

        <h4>Community website</h4>

        <p class="few">A community website is a website or section of a website that helps bring the visitors
            visiting the site <br>
            together using chat, forums, or another form of bulletin boards.</p>

        <h4>Content website and information website</h4>

        <p class="few">A <b>content website</b> and <b>information website</b> are created with the intention of
            displaying unique
            content <br>
            that is often related to a specific category. For example, Computer Hope could be considered a content
            <br>site with computer-related content. Other categories could include a <b>political website</b> with
            content
            <br>
            relating to politics or a political view, or a <b>religious website</b> with information about a
            specific
            religion.</p>

        <h4>Dating website</h4>

        <p class="few">A <b>dating website</b> is a site set up to help connect people who may be interested in
            meeting other people <br>
            or dating other people. Most dating websites require a small fee, require a description of yourself, and
            <br>
            often asks questions to help find people that would best match your interests.</p>

        <h4>E-commerce website</h4>

        <p class="few">An <b>e-commerce (electronic commerce) website</b> is any site <br>
            that was created with the intention of selling online goods or <br>
            <img src="./Asset/amazon.PNG" alt="">
            services. Amazon is an example of an e-commerce website. <br>
            An e-commerce website may be broken down even further <br>
            into one of the following subcategories.</p>

        <p class="few">An <b>affiliate website</b> is a website created with the intention of selling third-party
            products. For example, <br>
            Amazon has an affiliate program for anyone to link to their site and make a commission when products
            <br>
            are purchased. An affiliate website should not be confused with an e-commerce website.</p>

        <p class="few">An <b>auction website</b> is a website that allows other people to sell their goods or
            services. For example, <br>
            eBay is one of the most well-known online auction websites. See our online auction page for further <br>
            information and examples.</p>

        <p class="few">A <b>classified ads website</b> is a site that allows anyone to list goods or services,
            usually for free or at a <br>

        <p class="few"> A <b>crowdfunding website</b> is set up to help support a business, person, or another cause
            by making a one <br>
            time or monthly payment. An example of a crowdfunding website is Kickstarter.</p>

        <h4>Educational website</h4>

        <p class="few">An educational website is any website containing content that aids in learning. It could be a
            school <br>
            website, a library website, a homework assistance website, or any other tools for gaining knowledge <br>
            online.</p>

        <h4>Gaming website</h4>

        <p class="few">A <b>gaming website</b> is any website that features games that can be played on the website.
            Often these <br>
            online games are created using HTML5, Flash, or Java. Gaming websites should not be confused with a <br>
            gaming content website with content relevant to gaming with no actual games to play on the website.</p>

        <h4>Government website</h4>

        <p class="few">A <b>government website</b> is a department, local, or state government site that was created
            to help inform <br>
            the public about government business and services. A local government website may also be set up to <br>
            help promote tourism.</p>

        <p class="few"><b>Tip:</b> In the United States a government website has the domain suffix .gov. <br> In the
            United Kingdom, they
            use .gov.uk</p>

        <h4>Help and Q&A website</h4>

        <p class="p5">A help website and questions and answers website is a site <br>
            where anyone can post questions and other users help <br>

            you can ask any question is on the link below.</p>

        <h4>Malicious website</h4>

        <p class="few">A <b>malicious website</b> is any website that was set up with the <br>
            intention of infecting another computer or collecting <br>
            personal data. For example, a <b>malware website</b> is a site <br>created with the intention of
            infecting any visitor with malware, spyware, or a trojan horse. <br>These types
            of sites could have a download that's infected and, if downloaded, infects your computer.</p>

        <p class="tree"> Other common malicious websites include <b>phishing websites.</b> These sites are designed
            to look like other <br>
            official sites (e.g., your bank) with the hope that they can phish sensitive information such as your
            <br>
            username and password.</p>

        <p class="tree"><b>Fake news websites</b> are another type of malicious site created to appear as a
            legitimate source of news <br>
            with the intention of helping to spread fear and lies.</p>

        <h4>Media sharing website</h4>

        <p class="few">A <b>media sharing website</b> is any website that <br>
            specializes in allowing visitors to share one or more<br>
            <img src="./Asset/utube.PNG" alt="">
            types of media. For example, YouTube is a site for<br>
            sharing video media. SoundCloud is a site for sharing<br>
            music. Flickr is a place to share photos. DeviantArt is a page for sharing art.</p>

        <h4>Mirror website</h4>

        <p class="few">A <b>mirror website</b> is a complete duplicate of another website that is used when a
            website becomes<br>
            overloaded. It helps with a website's speed in different parts of the world. See our mirror definition
            for<br>
            further information. Also, although similar, a mirror site should not be confused with a scraper
            website<br>
            or a CDN.</p>

        <h4>News website</h4>

        <p class="few">A <b>news website</b> is a site dedicated to giving the latest local or world news. A news
            site may also be<br>
            dedicated to a specific topic. For example, many computer-related news websites are dedicated to
            talking<br>
            about the latest computer and technology related news.</p>
